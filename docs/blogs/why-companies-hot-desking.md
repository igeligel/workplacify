# Why Do Companies Do Hot Desking?

As a workplace experience manager, you're always looking for ways to improve your office environment. You want to create a space that is both productive and enjoyable for your employees. **Why do companies do hot desking?** This is a question that many workplace managers are asking themselves. Hot desking, a flexible seating arrangement where employees do not have assigned desks, has become a popular trend in recent years. But is it right for your company? This article will explore the reasons why companies are adopting hot desking, the benefits and drawbacks of this flexible workspace model, and how to implement it successfully. We will also look at some real-world examples and data to help you make an informed decision.

## What is Hot Desking?

Hot desking is an office organization system where desks are used by different people at different times. In a typical office, each employee has their own assigned desk. With hot desking, employees can choose where they want to sit each day. This can be a great way to save space and reduce costs, but it's not without its challenges.

### The Rise of the Flexible Workspace

The traditional office layout is becoming a thing of the past. Today's workforce is more mobile and flexible than ever before. With the rise of hybrid work models, many employees are splitting their time between the office and home. This means that on any given day, a significant portion of your office desks may be sitting empty. Hot desking is a direct response to this shift, allowing companies to make more efficient use of their office space. According to a 2024 survey, 60% of U.S. and Canadian employers now use some form of desk sharing.

## The Business Case for Hot Desking: Why Companies Make the Switch

So, why do companies do hot desking? The motivations are multifaceted, ranging from financial incentives to a desire for a more dynamic and collaborative work environment. Let's explore the key drivers behind the adoption of hot desking.

### Significant Cost Savings

One of the most compelling reasons for implementing hot desking is the potential for significant cost savings. With a hybrid workforce, it's no longer necessary to have a dedicated desk for every employee. By reducing the number of desks, companies can downsize their office footprint, leading to lower rent, utilities, and maintenance costs. In fact, some companies have reported saving up to 30% on their real estate costs after implementing a hot desking model.

### Increased Collaboration and Communication

Hot desking can break down departmental silos and encourage employees to interact with colleagues they might not otherwise meet. This increased communication and collaboration can lead to new ideas, improved problem-solving, and a stronger sense of community. When employees are free to choose where they sit, they can position themselves near different teams or individuals, fostering a more dynamic and cross-functional work environment.

### Flexibility for a Hybrid Workforce

Hot desking is a natural fit for companies with a hybrid work model. It provides employees with the flexibility to work in the office when they need to, without the company having to maintain a large, underutilized office space. This flexibility is a major draw for top talent, with 77% of employees considering flexible work arrangements before choosing an organization.

## The Employee Perspective: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

While hot desking offers clear benefits for companies, the employee experience can be a mixed bag. It's crucial to understand both the positive and negative aspects of hot desking from the employee's point of view.

### The Good: A Change of Scenery and New Connections

For some employees, hot desking is a welcome change from the monotony of sitting at the same desk every day. It offers the opportunity to choose a workspace that suits their mood and tasks for the day. It can also lead to new connections and friendships, as employees interact with a wider range of colleagues.

### The Bad: The Daily Desk Hunt and Lack of Personalization

For others, the daily scramble for a desk can be a source of stress and anxiety. The lack of a personal workspace can also be a major drawback, as employees are unable to personalize their desks with photos, plants, or other personal items. This can lead to a feeling of detachment from the company and a less comfortable work environment. As one Reddit user commented, "The worst part is the stress of not knowing where you'll be sitting each day."

### The Ugly: Hygiene Concerns and Territorial Disputes

In a hot desking environment, hygiene can be a major concern. With multiple people using the same desk and equipment, it's essential to have a robust cleaning protocol in place. Territorial disputes can also arise, with some employees attempting to "claim" a particular desk or area. These issues can create a negative and unproductive work environment if not addressed properly.

## How to Implement Hot Desking Successfully: A Guide for Workplace Managers

If you've decided that hot desking is the right choice for your company, it's important to implement it thoughtfully and strategically. Here are some best practices to ensure a smooth transition and a successful hot desking program.

### Invest in a Robust Desk Booking System

A user-friendly desk booking system is essential for a successful hot desking program. This will allow employees to easily see which desks are available and book a space in advance. A good booking system can also provide valuable data on desk usage, helping you to optimize your office layout and resources. If you're still using a spreadsheet to manage your desks, it might be time for an upgrade.

### Create a Variety of Workspaces

One of the biggest mistakes companies make with hot desking is simply replacing assigned desks with a sea of generic, identical workstations. To create a truly flexible and productive work environment, it's important to offer a variety of workspaces to suit different tasks and preferences. This could include quiet zones for focused work, collaborative areas for team projects, and comfortable lounge areas for informal meetings.

### Establish Clear Policies and Etiquette

To avoid confusion and conflict, it's important to establish clear policies and etiquette for your hot desking program. This should include guidelines on booking desks, cleaning up after yourself, and respecting the needs of your colleagues. Make sure to communicate these policies clearly to all employees and provide training on how to use the desk booking system.
